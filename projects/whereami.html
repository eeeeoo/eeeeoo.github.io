                    “Where am I?” is a question we often ask ourselves, even though we might not be lost geographically. It is a question that examines our relationship between ourselves and our surroundings. While we feel insecure when we are lost in space, it is interesting how we get accustomed to spaces, how we navigate without maps, and mind map spaces. People get comfortable with spaces, but how do we reach that phase?

                    This is a project of pedestrian signage developed by incorporating anthropological
                    thinking into design to navigate the Wellesley College campus. I aimed to translate my understanding of Wellesley into real experiences for people by trying to solve the problem of navigating within campus by using my experience, knowledge, and available tools in Wellesley.

                Wellesley's campus covers 500 acres and as many landscapes. The landscape has always been central to the identity of Wellesley College and to the experience of the students. Henry Fowle Durant, founder of the college, believed that "young women should be educated in the midst of beauty."

                Wellesley College is divided not only geographically by east and west campus, but also the dorms and the humanities and sciences are also divided.

                The Wellesley lamppost, first introduced in the 1920s, continues to represent an iconic element and constant variable in the college environment regardless of the changes in nature. The lamppost acts beyond the function as a lighting fixture, and has transformed into

              </ul>
              <p>
                Lampposts have become a reification of Wellesley College and its ideologies. The history of lamppost is also contained within the Wellesley College student’s souls.

              <span class="feature-title">The Physical Lamppost</span>
              <p>
                  I used the information to understand the appropriate height of the signs that would be attached to the lamppost. Assuming the majority of the students would identify their gender as female, I took the average height for women in the United States to create an approximate placement for the eyes and hands for the signs in ratio to the height of the lamppost.

                A shift from vernacular architecture damages the natural beauty and culture, so I tried to keep the vernacular style of Wellesley and the lamppost by using a specific color schemes. The “Wellesley Blue” color and class colors are important components that reflect the visual identity of Wellesley college.

The bus stop signs also has multiple sides like the lamppost, so the design of the lamppost and sign would blend together.
